Your name is Moses and you have to lead the Israelites through the desert to the Promised Land. Sadly, some of your
followers will perish during the journey. To prevent extinction of your people you have to at least help one
man and one woman to get to the Promised Land.

There are 3 desert levels you will have to conquer. You will do this by jumping (SPACE bar) over deadly obstacles.
In level 2 and 3 you can move faster and jump further if you hold down SHIFT. Before proceeding you will have to
sculpt the landscape. This can be done in Edit mode by left-clicking and dragging your cursor over the landscape.
Use the mouse scroll wheel to increase/decrease your brush size. Beware of burning tumbleweed, locusts and the
eroding wind...
